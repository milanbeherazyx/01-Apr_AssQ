    ">Linear regression and logistic regression are both statistical models used to predict the relationship between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable. However, they differ in terms of the type of dependent variable they can handle.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Linear regression is used when the dependent variable is continuous and numerical. For example, if you wanted to predict the price of a house based on its size, number of bedrooms, and location, you could use linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Logistic regression, on the other hand, is used when the dependent variable is binary or categorical, i.e., it can take only two values such as yes/no, true/false, or pass/fail. The goal of logistic regression is to predict the probability of a certain outcome occurring based on one or more independent variables. For example, if you wanted to predict the likelihood of a person buying a product based on their age, income, and education level, you could use logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    ">A scenario where logistic regression would be more appropriate is when you want to predict the likelihood of an event occurring or not. For instance, predicting whether a patient will develop a certain disease based on their medical history and demographic factors. Another example could be predicting whether a customer will churn or not based on their usage patterns and other customer attributes. In both cases, the dependent variable is binary and logistic regression would be more appropriate."

The logistic loss function measures the difference between the predicted probabilities and the actual binary labels.\n",

In other words, we find the set of parameter values that minimize the sum of the logistic loss function over the training examples. Gradient descent works by computing the gradient of the cost function with respect to the parameters and updating the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient.\n",

Overfitting occurs when a model learns the noise or random fluctuations in the training data, which can lead to poor performance on new, unseen data. Regularization works by adding a penalty term to the cost function that discourages the model from learning complex or overly flexible relationships between the input features and the output variable.\n",
    "\n",
    ">There are two common types of regularization used in logistic regression: L1 regularization and L2 regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    ">L1 regularization, also known as Lasso regularization, adds a penalty term to the cost function that is proportional to the absolute value of the model parameters. This penalty term encourages the model to select a subset of the most informative features and set the weights of the irrelevant or redundant features to zero. This can lead to a simpler and more interpretable model that is less prone to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    ">L2 regularization, also known as Ridge regularization, adds a penalty term to the cost function that is proportional to the square of the model parameters. This penalty term encourages the model to distribute the weight values across all the features, rather than assigning a high weight to just a few features. This can lead to a smoother and more stable model that is less prone to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Both L1 and L2 regularization can be controlled by a hyperparameter called the regularization strength, which determines the trade-off between the fit to the training data and the complexity of the model. By tuning this hyperparameter, we can find the optimal balance between the bias-variance trade-off and improve the generalization performance of the logistic regression model.\n",

The most commonly used method for univariate feature selection is the chi-squared test for categorical variables and the ANOVA F-test for continuous variables.\n",

The principal components are ordered by their variance, with the first principal component capturing the most variance in the data. By selecting a subset of the top principal components, we can reduce the dimensionality of the input space and improve the performance of the logistic regression model.\n",

By selecting a subset of the most informative features, we can reduce the complexity of the model and improve its generalization performance on new, unseen data. However, it is important to balance the reduction in dimensionality with the loss of information and potential overfitting.

To address this, we can use techniques such as polynomial regression, decision trees, or neural networks to model nonlinear relationships between the variables.\n",
